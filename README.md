# New York Housing Market Analysis 

### Business Task 

Analyze New York City housing data to uncover pricing trends, borough-level affordability, and how property characteristics (size, bedrooms, bathrooms, and type) influence home values. 

Goal: identify which boroughs offer the best value, explore luxury vs. median-market segmentation, and visualize how key property features drive price variation across NYC.

### Data Set 
- Property-level housing listings including price, square footage, beds, baths, and borough
- Derived fields for price per sq ft, price range categories, and borough groupings
- Source: [New York Housing Data - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyapande0/nyc-affordable-housing-production)

### Tools

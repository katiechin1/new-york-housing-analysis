Data Quality Checks

Minimal missing values (<3%) handled through imputation or removal.

Outliers above the 99th percentile in PRICE removed to improve visualization clarity.

Listings with PROPERTYSQFT <= 0 dropped.

Duplicate entries removed by address.

Standardized capitalization, spacing, and suffixes across text columns.

Property Type Cleanup

Removed property types that didn’t make sense or didn’t represent active listings:
“Coming Soon”, “Sold”, “Pending”, “Foreclosure”, “Auction”, “Off Market”, “Mobile House for Sale”.

Removed redundant text like “for sale” and “by owner”.

Grouped similar labels under consistent categories: Condo, Co-op, Townhouse, House, Multi-Family.

Result: Categorical consistency and elimination of irrelevant or misleading property types.

Derived Fields
New Field	Formula	Purpose
price_per_sqft	PRICE / PROPERTYSQFT	Compare affordability
price_range	Custom bins using pd.cut()	Segment listings by value
type_grouped	Cleaned & standardized TYPE	Used for dashboard visualization
